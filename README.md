# Pico weight scales
This repo provide information on how to construct your own Raspberry Pi Pico weighting scales. This project was made because I needed a very flat weighing scales to measure how much force a robot was putting down, and normal scales were too wide to fit.

I hope this code is useful to people wanting a fun educational project, or in their own research.
